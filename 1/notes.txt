- python version 3.8

BFS:
    - goal-test at code generation

IDS:
    - goal-test at code expansion
    - we don't have frontier
    - infinity recursive if tree search applied? no it doesn't happen
    - how to print count explored and generated node? count duplicates or not?
    - is the number of expanded and generated nodes same?
    - it doesn't have failure
    - generated nodes of previous steps are not count

A_STAR:
    - goal-test at code expansion
    - node.depth can be h(n)
    - heuristic is the sum of unsorted adjacent numbers & (count diff colors - 1)
